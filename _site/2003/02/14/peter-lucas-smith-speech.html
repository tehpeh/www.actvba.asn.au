<p><em>14 Feb 2003</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Chief Minister, distinguished guests, fellow fire-fighters, emergency service personnel and other volunteers. I stand before you a very proud man. Over the past month you have proven an inspiration to not only the men and women of the A.C.T. but to all Australians.</p>

<p>Not only have you achieved a massive victory in overcoming nature&#8217;s worst, you have achieved a broader social and community objective of winning the confidence and respect of the A.C.T. community during a period of unparalleled turmoil.</p>

<p>What is frequently lost in discussion of natural disasters is the true ferocity of the challenge confronting those involved in meeting disasters head on. It has been widely accepted that the fire storm you so bravely fought was the most ferocious ever encountered in this country.</p>

<p>For a relatively small city that daunting challenge meant defeating fires impacting on about 70km of urban interface and affecting about 70% of the entire A.C.T.</p>

<p>While we have all been devastated by the loses resulting from the fires, I can not help but think of how much worse it could have been if it had not been for your outstanding efforts. Each day as I drive to work through the Glen Lock interchange I can imagine the damage that would have been done to North Canberra if the fire had got into Black Mountain and then Aranda, Bruce, O&#8217;Connor had we not succeeded in stopping the fires crossing that key boundary. Victories such as this, the many rural properties saved, and the many other small victories should not be lost in any of the discussion of what was achieved in protecting our great community.</p>

<p>We all must now stay focused on continuing to provide the best fire fighting support to the A.C.T. community and do everything in our power to help rebuild the community in which we live and love. I am very grateful for this opportunity to thank you all for what you have done, and will continue to do for the A.C.T. You have done a superb job, and I along with the A.C.T. am very proud of you all.</p>

<p>Thank you.&#8221;</p>
