<p><em>01 Mar 2003</em></p>

<p>For many of us the recent fires in Canberra, and the A.C.T. generally, have generated new emotions, thoughts and experiences that we do not wish to repeat. For some of us, at least, it has been, and is, hard to express how we feel and to convey it adequately to others.</p>

<p>However, at least in my local community, there has been a great spirit of community and sense of appreciation for all those who have helped. I suspect that this is general.</p>

<p>The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council has just held their first meeting since the fires. One regular meeting was cancelled because of the involvement, one way or another, of so many members. One of the first acts of the meeting was to unanimously pass the following resolution:</p>

<p>&#8220;The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council mourns the tragic loss of 4 lives and recognises the very significant loss of property, pets and family treasures that accompanied the unprecedented Canberra fires in January 2003.</p>

<p>We appreciate the commitment, skill and dedication of both volunteer (Bushfire Brigades and Emergency Services both local and interstate) and government fire fighters (rural and urban, local and interstate) in the recent crisis.</p>

<p>Council is deeply sympathetic to those fire fighters and other emergency workers who suffered substantial personal losses in the course of their involvement.</p>

<p>Our gratitude extends to those who came from far and wide to help clean up after the fires and continue to offer their support to Canberrans and our rural communities.&#8221;</p>
