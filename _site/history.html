            <h2 id='early_bushfire_history_in_the_act'>Early Bushfire History in the A.C.T.</h2>

<p>There are very few records regarding bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory (Limestone Plains) during the first quarter of the twentieth century. The following gives a brief outline of this period of time.</p>

<p>Around 1903 the Limestone Plains Bushfire Brigade was formed. The last day of 1904 was the hottest on record, on the following day, 1 January 1905, a bushfire swept through the Wallaroo and Ginninderra areas. After these fires a public meeting was called to discuss bushfire prevention and suppression and a executive committee was formed to decide the location of firebreaks and call meetings as required.</p>

<p>On Monday 14 November 1927 the Bush Fire Control Organization had its inaugural meeting. The Chief Fire Controller was Mr M. R. Jacobs (Chief Forester). The Organization setup fire depots at MacDonald&#8217;s Camp near Weetangera, Weavers&#8217; Property near Stromlo, Maxwells&#8217; Property at The Rivers, Gregorys&#8217; Property at Kambah and Horans&#8217; Property near the Yarralumla. The equipment at these depots included fire Carts, beaters, rakes &amp; axes, with horses for the fire carts being supplied by various Rural Lessees.</p>

<p>The severe bushfires which caused widespread damage in the Australian Capital Territory in January 1939, was the subject of enquiry by a Bush Fire Committee appointed by the Minister of State for the Interior, the Honorable J. McEwen, M.P.. Among the recommendations was one favouring the appointment of a permanent Bush Fire Council to <em>organize the prevention and suppression of bushfires in the A.C.T.</em> , its inaugural meeting was held on the 18 August.</p>

<p>During the 1943-1944 Bushfire Season, Fire Protection Associations were formed under the aegis of the Bush Fire Council, the first being the Mulligan&#8217;s Flat Bush Fire Brigade and the second the Weetangera Bush Fire Brigade. The Hall &amp; Tuggeranong Bush Fire Brigades were formed during the 1944-1945 Bushfire Season and the Tidbinbilla Bush Fire Brigade was formed at a meeting held on 25 February 1951. After the fires of 1951-1952 three more Bush Fire Brigades were formed; the Fairlight Bush Fire Brigade, the Kambah Bush Fire Brigade and the Woden Bush Fire Brigade&#8217;s, whose inaugural meeting was held on July 16 1952.</p>

<p>During the 1952-1953 Bushfire Season the Mulligan&#8217;s Flat Bush Fire Brigade proposed the formation of an Association of recognized A.C.T. Bush Fire Brigades. However the proposal was not accepted by the various Brigades.</p>

<p>On the 11 December 1956 the inaugural Meeting of the Majura Bush Fire Brigade was held, while the Williamsdale Bush Fire Brigade was formed in 1957. Around 1962 two more Bush Fire Brigades were formed, these being the Tharwa Bush Fire Brigade and the Charnwood Bush Fire Brigade. The old Hall Bush Fire Brigade died out in the 1960&#8217;s with the Woden Bush Fire Brigade disbanding in the early 1970&#8217;s. In 1972 the Kambah Bush Fire Brigade combined with Fairlight-The Rivers Bush Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>After the &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221; fire - February 13 1979 , Mr Jim Rochford gathered together a group of local&#8217;s and in October 1979 the Hall Volunteer Bushfire Brigade was formed.</p>

<h2 id='act_volunteer_brigades_association'>A.C.T. Volunteer Brigades&#8217; Association</h2>

<p>The inaugural meeeting of the Volunteer Bush Fire Brigades Association was held at Forestry House Yarralumla on 22 November 1984. There were six Brigades represented Majura, Fairlight, Hall, Williamsdale, Tidbinbilla and Tharwa/Naas. Tony Johnson from Tharwa was elected as the first Chairman with Brian O&#8217;Connor (Hall) as his Deputy and Noel Teys (Tharwa/Naas) as Secretary / Treasurer. The following is an extract from a letter from Cliff Parsons, the then CFCO, to the first Annual General Meeting: <em>&#8216;If the Association is to work, and if Bush Fire Council is to be strong and effective, Brigade members must elect the best people to represent them!&#8217;</em></p>

<p>Over the years, two of Brigades disbanded (Fairlight-Rivers and Majura), and the Tharwa and Naas brigades merged to become Southern Districts VBB. On November 11 1986 the Jerrabomberra VBB officially formed, later in 1988 the old Williamsdale Brigade split into two , these became the Williamsdale Bush Fire Brigade (N.S.W.) and the Guises Creek Volunteer Bushfire Brigade (A.C.T.). At a meeting on 31 August 1989, the Fairlight Bush Fire Brigade decided to confine its operations to New South Wales and as a result the Rivers VBB was formed 11 October 1989. The Mount Stromlo Observatory Fire Brigade (which was originally formed around 1959) joined the Association in 1992.</p>

<p>The Official Launch of the Hall Junior Volunteer Bushfire Brigade was held at the Hall Fire Shed on Monday 25 March 1996. The Mount Stromlo Observatory Fire Brigade disbanded on the 30th June 1996.</p>

<p>On the 1 November 1996 the A.C.T. Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Gary Humphries announced a new Volunteer Joint Middle Management and Command Structure for the Bushfire Service (BS) and the A.C.T. Emergency Service (ACTES). This resulted in the co-location of the ACTES elements at a number of existing Volunteer Bushfire Brigades and the formation of 2 new volunteer brigades, Gungahlin (9 February 1997) and Molonglo (6 May 1997).</p>

<p>This put the Association in an unique position of representing both volunteer bushfire fighters and Emergency Service personnel and in early 1998 the Association was renamed - The A.C.T. Volunteer Brigades Association.</p>
