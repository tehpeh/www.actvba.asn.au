## Welcome to our website!

Welcome to the new ACT Volunteer Brigades Association website.

The site will progressively improve over the coming months with the intent to offer a facility that not only provides up to date information for volunteers, but also an additional forum to get grass root volunteer input and feedback on key issues.

Many thanks to [Pat Barling](http://www.firebreak.com.au) for creating this site.

## Upcoming events

**Field Day on the 23rd October 2011** promises yet again to be a fun and challenging event for volunteers to test their skills. It's also a great opportunity to catch up with old friends from other brigades.

## Current Volunteer Issues

Need to ensure proposed changes to road transport legislation provide log book exemptions for volunteers to prevent overwhelming paperwork and consider driving requirements of volunteers during emergency events and how this will impact volunteers who drive heavy vehicles for a living.
