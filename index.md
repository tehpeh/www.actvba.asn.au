## Welcome to our website!

Welcome to the new ACT Volunteer Brigades Association website.

The site will progressively improve over the coming months with the intent to offer a facility that not only provides up to date information for volunteers, but also an additional forum to get grass root volunteer input and feedback on key issues.

Many thanks to [Pat Barling](http://www.firebreak.com.au) for creating this site.

<br />
## Upcoming events

**RFS Gala Dinner to be held Saturday 20th August 2011** to thank volunteers for their contributions to emergency services in the last year.

**Wattle Day fundraising on the 27th and 28th August 2011** in collaboration with the [Wattle Day Association](http://www.wattleday.asn.au/) is the only fundraising event the VBA undertakes each year. Brigades will be selling Wattle Day badges at local shopping centres around Canberra. Wattle Day is on September 1st.

## Current Volunteer Issues

Need to ensure proposed changes to road transport legislation provide log book exemptions for volunteers to prevent overwhelming paperwork and consider driving requirements of volunteers during emergency events and how this will impact volunteers who drive heavy vehicles for a living.
