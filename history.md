## Early Bushfire History in the A.C.T.

There are very few records regarding bushfires in the
Australian Capital Territory (Limestone Plains) during the first
quarter of the twentieth century. The following gives a brief
outline of this period of time.

Around 1903 the Limestone Plains Bushfire Brigade was formed.
The last day of 1904 was the hottest on record, on the following
day, 1 January 1905, a bushfire swept through the Wallaroo and
Ginninderra areas. After these fires a public meeting was called
to discuss bushfire prevention and suppression and a executive
committee was formed to decide the location of firebreaks and
call meetings as required.

On Monday 14 November 1927 the Bush Fire Control Organization
had its inaugural meeting. The Chief Fire Controller was Mr M.
R. Jacobs (Chief Forester). The Organization setup fire depots
at MacDonald's Camp near Weetangera, Weavers' Property near
Stromlo, Maxwells' Property at The Rivers, Gregorys' Property at
Kambah and Horans' Property near the Yarralumla. The equipment
at these depots included fire Carts, beaters, rakes & axes,
with horses for the fire carts being supplied by various Rural
Lessees.

The severe bushfires which caused widespread damage in the
Australian Capital Territory in January 1939, was the subject of
enquiry by a Bush Fire Committee appointed by the Minister of
State for the Interior, the Honorable J. McEwen, M.P.. Among the
recommendations was one favouring the appointment of a permanent
Bush Fire Council to *organize the prevention and suppression
of bushfires in the A.C.T.* , its inaugural meeting was held
on the 18 August.

During the 1943-1944 Bushfire Season, Fire Protection Associations
were formed under the aegis of the Bush Fire Council, the first
being the Mulligan's Flat Bush Fire Brigade and the second
the Weetangera Bush Fire Brigade. The Hall & Tuggeranong Bush
Fire Brigades were formed during the 1944-1945 Bushfire Season and
the Tidbinbilla Bush Fire Brigade was formed at a meeting held on
25 February 1951. After the fires of 1951-1952 three more Bush Fire
Brigades were formed; the Fairlight Bush Fire Brigade, the Kambah
Bush Fire Brigade and the Woden Bush Fire Brigade's, whose
inaugural meeting was held on July 16 1952.

During the 1952-1953 Bushfire Season the Mulligan's Flat
Bush Fire Brigade proposed the formation of an Association of
recognized A.C.T. Bush Fire Brigades. However the proposal was
not accepted by the various Brigades.

On the 11 December 1956 the inaugural Meeting of the Majura
Bush Fire Brigade was held, while the Williamsdale Bush Fire
Brigade was formed in 1957. Around 1962 two more Bush Fire
Brigades were formed, these being the Tharwa Bush Fire Brigade
and the Charnwood Bush Fire Brigade. The old Hall Bush Fire
Brigade died out in the 1960's with the Woden Bush Fire
Brigade disbanding in the early 1970's. In 1972 the Kambah
Bush Fire Brigade combined with Fairlight-The Rivers Bush Fire
Brigade.

After the "Black Tuesday" fire - February 13 1979 , Mr Jim
Rochford gathered together a group of local's and in October
1979 the Hall Volunteer Bushfire Brigade was formed.

## A.C.T. Volunteer Brigades' Association

The inaugural meeeting of the Volunteer Bush Fire Brigades
Association was held at Forestry House Yarralumla on 22 November
1984. There were six Brigades represented Majura, Fairlight,
Hall, Williamsdale, Tidbinbilla and Tharwa/Naas. Tony Johnson
from Tharwa was elected as the first Chairman with Brian
O'Connor (Hall) as his Deputy and Noel Teys (Tharwa/Naas)
as Secretary / Treasurer. The following is an extract from a
letter from Cliff Parsons, the then CFCO, to the first Annual
General Meeting: *'If the Association is to work, and if
Bush Fire Council is to be strong and effective, Brigade members
must elect the best people to represent them!'*

Over the years, two of Brigades disbanded (Fairlight-Rivers and
Majura), and the Tharwa and Naas brigades merged to become
Southern Districts VBB. On November 11 1986 the Jerrabomberra
VBB officially formed, later in 1988 the old Williamsdale
Brigade split into two , these became the Williamsdale Bush Fire
Brigade (N.S.W.) and the Guises Creek Volunteer Bushfire Brigade
(A.C.T.). At a meeting on 31 August 1989, the Fairlight Bush
Fire Brigade decided to confine its operations to New South
Wales and as a result the Rivers VBB was formed 11 October 1989.
The Mount Stromlo Observatory Fire Brigade (which was originally
formed around 1959) joined the Association in 1992.

The Official Launch of the Hall Junior Volunteer Bushfire
Brigade was held at the Hall Fire Shed on Monday 25 March 1996.
The Mount Stromlo Observatory Fire Brigade disbanded on the 30th
June 1996.

On the 1 November 1996 the A.C.T. Minister for Police and
Emergency Services, Gary Humphries announced a new Volunteer
Joint Middle Management and Command Structure for the Bushfire
Service (BS) and the A.C.T. Emergency Service (ACTES). This
resulted in the co-location of the ACTES elements at a number of
existing Volunteer Bushfire Brigades and the formation of 2 new
volunteer brigades, Gungahlin (9 February 1997) and Molonglo (6
May 1997).

This put the Association in an unique position of representing
both volunteer bushfire fighters and Emergency Service personnel
and in early 1998 the Association was renamed - The A.C.T.
Volunteer Brigades Association.
