On a day when we celebrate matters of the heart, it is good to know volunteer
firefighters are being heart smart.

This summer as well as keeping the Nation’s heartland and capital safe from bushfires, volunteer rural firefighters will be keeping the community’s hearts beating a little easier.

The ACT Volunteer Brigades Association (VBA) will tomorrow take delivery of eight new Automated Externals Defibulators (AEDs).

“The devices have been purchased by VBA for each of the ACT Rural Fire Service (ACTRFS) volunteer command vehicles in the ACT,” ACT Volunteer Brigades Association President, Melissa Riches said.

“The AEDs will be available on the fireground as well as at the numerous community events that volunteer brigades attend throughout Canberra during the year,” she said.

“The purchase of the AEDs, bought by volunteers for volunteers to use, is really just continuing the theme of keeping the community safe.

“We have been telling Canberrans to PREPARE.ACT.SURVIVE for bushfire events and this is about us doing a similar thing and being ready and able to provide first aid assistance whenever we are required to do so.”
