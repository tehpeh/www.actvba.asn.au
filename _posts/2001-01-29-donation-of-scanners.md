The Volunteer Brigades Association has donated 18 scanners to the various
brigades. These scanners were purchased with money obtained under the
Commonwealth Government small equipment grant. The scanners are to be
used by the various brigade BFS and ES personnel as they see fit. The VBA
has documented the serial number of each scanner so that its identity can
be confirmed in the future.

The scanners were distributed as follows, three scanners to both Hall
and Jerrabomberra, one scanner to Headquarters and Tidbinbilla and two
scanners for all remaining brigades.

Each scanner becomes the property of the individual brigade to use in
the service of volunteer work. It is hoped that the VBA can be
successful in future grant applications to the benefit of volunteer
members.
