For many of us the recent fires in Canberra, and the A.C.T. generally,
have generated new emotions, thoughts and experiences that we do not wish
to repeat. For some of us, at least, it has been, and is, hard to express
how we feel and to convey it adequately to others.

However, at least in my local community, there has been a great
spirit of community and sense of appreciation for all those who have
helped. I suspect that this is general.

The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council has just held their first meeting since
the fires. One regular meeting was cancelled because of the
involvement, one way or another, of so many members. One of the first
acts of the meeting was to unanimously pass the following resolution:

"The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council mourns the tragic loss of 4
lives and recognises the very significant loss of property, pets and
family treasures that accompanied the unprecedented Canberra fires in
January 2003.

We appreciate the commitment, skill and dedication of both
volunteer (Bushfire Brigades and Emergency Services both local and
interstate) and government fire fighters (rural and urban, local and
interstate) in the recent crisis.

Council is deeply sympathetic to those fire fighters and other
emergency workers who suffered substantial personal losses in the
course of their involvement.

Our gratitude extends to those who came from far and wide to help
clean up after the fires and continue to offer their support to
Canberrans and our rural communities."
