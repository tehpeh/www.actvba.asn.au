This Sunday the Canberra community is welcome to come and see the volunteers that proudly provide the Territory bush and grass fire protection showcase their skills as they compete in the annual ACT Volunteer Brigades Association (VBA) Field Day at the ACT Rural Fire Service Helibase at Hume.

ACT volunteer bushfire brigades as well as several neighbouring NSW Rural Fire Service brigades will converge on the Helibase on Sunday morning from 9am to be challenged by a range of events that test their skill set for bush and grass fire suppression.

VBA Co-ordinator of the Field Day, Mr Dave Wassall said “scenarios are set for the crews around circumstances they will face on a fireline. It is all very practical, so things like pumping and drafting water, direct attack techniques on a range of fire sources, chainsaw operations, first aid, radio communications, crew management and tanker operations are all included. But probably most importantly the focus of the day is on teamwork and safe operations “.

 The ACT Volunteer Brigade Association’s Field Day has been run since 1986. It also provides ACT volunteers with an important training opportunity as well as the chance for brigades to share operational knowledge as we enter a potentially busy 2012-13 fire season.

“It is a fun day with a serious intent,” said Mr Wassall “and of course a great chance for the public to come and see what our volunteers can do. Combined with an Open Day by the ACT Rural Fire Service it really is about preparation, preparedness and response”.

So if you have never seen a rural firefighter in action, or would just like to talk to one about your own bushfire preparation and planning, you are welcome to come out to the ACTRFS Helibase at Hume and be part of the day.
