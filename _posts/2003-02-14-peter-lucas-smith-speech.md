"Chief Minister, distinguished guests, fellow fire-fighters, emergency
service personnel and other volunteers. I stand before you a very proud
man. Over the past month you have proven an inspiration to not only the
men and women of the A.C.T. but to all Australians.

Not only have you achieved a massive victory in overcoming
nature's worst, you have achieved a broader social and community
objective of winning the confidence and respect of the A.C.T.
community during a period of unparalleled turmoil.

What is frequently lost in discussion of natural disasters is the
true ferocity of the challenge confronting those involved in meeting
disasters head on. It has been widely accepted that the fire storm you
so bravely fought was the most ferocious ever encountered in this
country.

For a relatively small city that daunting challenge meant defeating
fires impacting on about 70km of urban interface and affecting about
70% of the entire A.C.T.

While we have all been devastated by the loses resulting from the
fires, I can not help but think of how much worse it could have been
if it had not been for your outstanding efforts. Each day as I drive
to work through the Glen Lock interchange I can imagine the damage
that would have been done to North Canberra if the fire had got into
Black Mountain and then Aranda, Bruce, O'Connor had we not
succeeded in stopping the fires crossing that key boundary. Victories
such as this, the many rural properties saved, and the many other
small victories should not be lost in any of the discussion of what
was achieved in protecting our great community.

We all must now stay focused on continuing to provide the best fire
fighting support to the A.C.T. community and do everything in our
power to help rebuild the community in which we live and love. I am
very grateful for this opportunity to thank you all for what you have
done, and will continue to do for the A.C.T. You have done a superb
job, and I along with the A.C.T. am very proud of you all.

Thank you."
