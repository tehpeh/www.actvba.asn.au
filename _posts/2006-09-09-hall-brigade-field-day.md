Volunteers from the ACT Rural Fire Service held their annual field
day today with crews from across the Territory and NSW taking part.

"This event is being held by the volunteers, for the volunteers
and is a great way to ensure preparations, equipment and skills are
tested prior to the beginning of the bushfire season," ACT RFS
Hall Volunteer Rural Fire Brigade Captain Tony Greep said.

"The event will see participation from 20 volunteer bushfire
fighting crews, including some from NSW, and will include the use of
both light and heavy Tankers and other important rural firefighting
equipment," he said.

"This is an important event on the RFS calendar, and is a great
way for us to exercise our crews, and equipment. While our crews do
some training during winter, this will help shake the dust off well
ahead of the official start to the bushfire season."

"Crews will take part in light and heavy Tanker and hose drill,
first aid drill and equipment drill, to name just a few. This is a
chance for our volunteers to show case their abilities and highlight
areas where they would like to improve their skills."
