>To all members of the Bushfire and Emergency Service

Please accept my sincere thanks for the extraordinary contribution you
have made in fighting the extreme fire conditions in our region. I am
aware that a letter is not sufficient to cover the range of issues I
would like to discuss with you, however am keen to establish a
communication path with you as soon as possible. Once time and
operational situations permit, I will seek to meet face to face with as
many of you as possible.

The scale and duration of these fires is unprecedented. All our
training and preparation for normal bushfires may have seemed
inadequate in the face of such an overwhelmingly ferocious fire. Many
lives and much property were saved and no firefighters were seriously
injured during this extraordinary event -- this is undoubtedly
due to your actions and perseverance at this time. This is something
of which we can all be justly proud.

I take great pride in the response we have provided over an extended
period of time. Further we need to take to heart the tremendous
gratitude being expressed by the Canberra community.

Some of you have suffered serious losses and many of you have had
terrifying experiences while fighting the fires. All of you have
worked long and arduous shifts without yet experiencing the
satisfaction of having these fires beaten. As a result you or members
of your family may be feeling anxious, angry or distressed. Please
recognise that these are all quite normal reactions in such abnormal
circumstances and remember our employee support services are available
to you and your family if you wish to use them.

Clearly, there is a need for us to review recent events and learn the
lessons that our recent events have taught us. I will be meeting with
the Land Managers Fire Liaison Group, Fire Controllers Group, the
Commanders Group and the Volunteer Brigades Association over the next
few weeks to discuss our recent experiences. I am keen to ensure you
all have an opportunity to contribute to our future direction - your
experiences, ideas and comments are invaluable.

The willingness and tenacity of everyone in such extraordinary
circumstances humble me. This is a clear demonstration of the value
and contribution our services makes to our community.

Continue to support one another as you continue to protect the
community.
