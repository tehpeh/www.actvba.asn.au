      <h3>
          From the Chairman of the A.C.T. Bush Fire Council .......
      </h3>
      For many of us the recent fires in Canberra, and the A.C.T. generally,
      have generated new emotions, thoughts and experiences that we do not wish
      to repeat. For some of us, at least, it has been, and is, hard to express
      how we feel and to convey it adequately to others. 
      <p>
          However, at least in my local community, there has been a great
         spirit of community and sense of appreciation for all those who have
         helped. I suspect that this is general.

          The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council has just held their first meeting since
         the fires. One regular meeting was cancelled because of the
         involvement, one way or another, of so many members. One of the first
         acts of the meeting was to unanimously pass the following resolution:
      </p>
      <p>
          <i>&ldquo;The A.C.T. Bush Fire Council mourns the tragic loss of 4
         lives and recognises the very significant loss of property, pets and
         family treasures that accompanied the unprecedented Canberra fires in
         January 2003.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
          <i> We appreciate the commitment, skill and dedication of both
         volunteer (Bushfire Brigades and Emergency Services both local and
         interstate) and government fire fighters (rural and urban, local and
         interstate) in the recent crisis.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i> Council is deeply sympathetic to those fire fighters and other
         emergency workers who suffered substantial personal losses in the
         course of their involvement.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
         <i> Our gratitude extends to those who came from far and wide to help
         clean up after the fires and continue to offer their support to
         Canberrans and our rural communities."</i>
