         Hall Rural Fire Brigade hosts VBA Annual Field Day
      </h3>
      Saturday, 9 September, 2006 
      <p>
          Volunteers from the ACT Rural Fire Service held their annual field
         day today with crews from across the Territory and NSW taking part.
      </p>
      <p>
          &ldquo;This event is being held by the volunteers, for the volunteers
         and is a great way to ensure preparations, equipment and skills are
         tested prior to the beginning of the bushfire season,&rdquo; ACT RFS
         Hall Volunteer Rural Fire Brigade Captain Tony Greep said.
      </p>
      <p>
          &ldquo;The event will see participation from 20 volunteer bushfire
         fighting crews, including some from NSW, and will include the use of
         both light and heavy Tankers and other important rural firefighting
         equipment,&rdquo; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
          &ldquo;This is an important event on the RFS calendar, and is a great
         way for us to exercise our crews, and equipment. While our crews do
         some training during winter, this will help shake the dust off well
         ahead of the official start to the bushfire season.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
          &ldquo;Crews will take part in light and heavy Tanker and hose drill,
         first aid drill and equipment drill, to name just a few. This is a
         chance for our volunteers to show case their abilities and highlight
         areas where they would like to improve their skills.&rdquo;
