      <h3>
         Donation of Scanners
      </h3>
      The Volunteer Brigades Association has donated 18 scanners to the various
      brigades. These scanners were purchased with money obtained under the
      Commonwealth Government small equipment grant. The scanners are to be
      used by the various brigade BFS and ES personnel as they see fit. The VBA
      has documented the serial number of each scanner so that its identity can
      be confirmed in the future. 
      <p>
         The scanners were distributed as follows, three scanners to both Hall
         and Jerrabomberra, one scanner to Headquarters and Tidbinbilla and two
         scanners for all remaining brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
         Each scanner becomes the property of the individual brigade to use in
         the service of volunteer work. It is hoped that the VBA can be
         successful in future grant applications to the benefit of volunteer
         members.
